## What is Figure to Ground in Photography?

Mastering this technique involves understanding how to use elements like:

*   **Contrast:** Using differences in color, tone, and texture to differentiate the subject.
*   **Shape and Form:** Utilizing distinct shapes and forms to create a clear separation.
*   **Focus:** Employing shallow depth of field to blur the background and emphasize the subject.
*   **Light:** Using light and shadow to highlight the figure and recede the ground.
